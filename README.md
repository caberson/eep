Enlightenment Foundation tools
===============
This project provide a few tools that I use to semi-automate some tedious
tasks at the organization that I volunteer at.  The script mainly deal with
reading and creating Excel files that are needed every six months.

While these tools work, they do require a LOT of cleanup.


Requirements
===============
* Python 2.7.
* xlrd, xlwt and xlutils library.  
  Source: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd  
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt  
          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlutils  


Usage
===============
I'm not going to provide usage here (at least not now) as these tools are made
specifically for my organization and I doubt other people can use it without
heavy modifications.  But if you are curious as to how I use these tools, refer
to the readme.txt.  That's my personal cheat sheet.
